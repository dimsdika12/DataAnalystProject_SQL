# Stackoverflow Project
For this SQL project, we will be leveraging the comprehensive Stack Overflow dataset available on BigQuery. 
Access the dataset through this link: [Stack Overflow BigQuery Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1sbigquery-public-data!2sstackoverflow&project).
------------------------------
This project encompasses a series of analytical queries designed to extract valuable insights from the dataset:

**1.Python Related Questions and Answers in 2020:** Retrieve all questions and their corresponding answers related to the Python programming language specifically within the year 2020.

**2.Indonesian User Contributions by Year:** Determine the count of questions created annually by Indonesian users, spanning from 2015 to 2020.

**3.Badge Recipients in January 2020:** Identify usernames that received badges in January 2020, creating a unique ranking based on the time they received each badge per class.

**4.Trend Analysis of BigQuery Related Questions:** Analyze the year in which questions related to BigQuery received the most answers, generating a unique ranking to track this trend.

**5.Time Spent on Answering Questions:** Calculate the average time span in hours for individuals who provided a minimum of 5000 answers. The time span refers to the difference between answering consecutive questions.

**6.User Location Insights:** List the top 10 locations with the highest concentration of users within the Stack Overflow community.

**7.Distribution of Questions vs. Active Years:** For managerial insights, provide distributions showcasing the number of questions a person creates based on their active years. This analysis will include percentiles at 10, 25, 75, 95, and the median.
